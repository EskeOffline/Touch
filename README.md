# Touch
A simple 3ds touch input detector.
Also my very first hb app.



This application is really simple, i am still learning how to code. It features input detection (says FALSE if you are not touching, TRUE otherwise), plus X and Y coordinate display. I am planning to add some stuff to make at least an ok application. 
There are also a few issues in the application name (both 3dsx and cia files).
It's basically a useless app. Only use i can see is checking if the input works properly or not, but you'll notice if there's any issues on whaterver game which requires an input on the touchscreen to progress. So yeah pretty useless.
