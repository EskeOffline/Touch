# Touch
A simple 3ds touch input detector.
Also my very first hb app.



This application is really simple, i am still learning how to code. It features input detection (says FALSE if you are not touching, TRUE otherwise), plus X and Y coordinate display. I am planning to add some stuff to make at least an ok application.
